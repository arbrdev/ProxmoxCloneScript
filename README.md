### **Summary of the Script's Functionality and Features**

🔍 **Node Verification at Start**:  
Before starting any other process, the script **checks the availability of the source node and the destination node**. If both are available, it proceeds with the migration process. These checks ensure that the script does not attempt migration if any of the nodes are not accessible, preventing potential errors and unexpected behavior.

💡 **Note**: Before running the script, make sure you have authorized access to the hosts using the following SSH commands:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "root@local"  # If you already have an ID, this may not be necessary.
ssh-copy-id root@<ip_host_1>
ssh-copy-id root@<ip_host_2>
```

🛠 **This script automates the migration of a virtual machine (VM) between two nodes in a Proxmox environment**, executed from a third Linux machine that accesses the nodes via SSH. The key features and functionalities are:

---

### 🖥️ **Remote Execution**:
- The script is executed from an **external control machine** and uses SSH to run commands on both the source and destination nodes. This ensures a **remote and automated migration** process.

---

### 📥 **Input Parameters**:
- **VM ID** is required as a mandatory argument.
- Accepts two additional options:
  - `--force-shutdown`: To shut down the VM if it is running.
  - `--snapshot`: To handle snapshot references during the migration process.

---

### 🔍 **Snapshot and VM State Verification**:
- Checks if the VM has snapshots on the source node. If snapshots are detected, the process is paused until they are removed.
- Verifies the **VM’s status**. If it's running and `--force-shutdown` is specified, it gracefully shuts down the VM before proceeding.

---

### 🔄 **Verification and Cleanup on the Destination Node**:
- Before migration, checks if the VM already exists on the destination node. If associated disks exist, they are removed only if they are still configured.

---

### 📤 **Copying VM Configuration and Disks**:
- **Transfers the VM’s configuration file** from the source node to the destination node using `scp` over SSH.
- Copies the VM’s disks using the `pvesm export/import` command through SSH, displaying **detailed progress for each disk**.

---

### 🗂 **Snapshot Handling**:
- If `--snapshot` is specified, the script **removes snapshot references** in the VM configuration file on the destination node, ensuring a clean setup.

---

### 🎉 **Completion**:
- Once the migration is complete, the script displays a **success message** to indicate that the process finished successfully.

---

### **To-Do List** 📝

🔧 **Implement Error Handling**:
- Add detailed error handling and logging to track and resolve issues during migration.
- Create logs for each migration step, especially in case of failure.

📧 **Add Email Notifications**:
- Send email alerts to admins when a migration starts, completes, or fails.
- Include important details like VM ID, migration status, and errors encountered.

🖥️ **Support for Multiple VMs**:
- Modify the script to handle multiple VM migrations simultaneously or sequentially by accepting a list of VM IDs.

🚧 **Dry Run Option**:
- Add a `--dry-run` option that simulates the migration process without making any actual changes, allowing users to verify steps in advance.

🌐 **Support for Different Hypervisors**:
- Extend support for other virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V) in addition to Proxmox.

📊 **Progress Bar for Disk Transfer**:
- Implement a visual progress bar to give better feedback during the disk transfer process.

📸 **Enhanced Snapshot Management**:
- Automatically manage snapshots by creating new ones before migration or merging them post-migration.

⚖️ **Load Balancing Across Nodes**:
- Add functionality to balance the load between multiple destination nodes, selecting the one with the most resources.

🔐 **User Authentication Improvements**:
- Enhance SSH authentication by supporting more secure methods, such as using SSH certificates or two-factor authentication (2FA).

🌍 **Web Interface for Management**:
- Develop a simple web interface where users can start, monitor migrations, view logs, and configure settings.

💻 **Cross-Platform Support**:
- Ensure smooth operation on different Linux distributions and explore support for Windows or macOS control machines.

🧪 **Unit Testing**:
- Implement unit tests to ensure the stability of core script components during future changes.

📅 **Scheduling Functionality**:
- Add a feature to schedule migrations at specific times, useful for maintenance windows.

📊 **Resource Pre-checks**:
- Implement pre-migration checks for CPU, RAM, and disk space on both nodes to prevent failures due to resource shortages.

↩️ **Rollback Mechanism**:
- Add a rollback feature to revert to the original state if migration fails midway, minimizing downtime.

---

💡 These improvements will enhance the current functionality and make the script **more versatile**, **user-friendly**, and **reliable** in larger production environments.
